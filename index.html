    <h2> Remembering Steve</h2>
          <p>I sit here recollecting and typing on the first Apple product that I purchased five years ago, the MacBook. You are one of the greatest innovator of our time. Just like this laptop, your ideas, your imagination, your creativity, and your legacy will never be die.</p>

       <h2>U will always be missed and remembered</h2>
          <p>Thank you for everything you've done to change the world Mr. Jobs. You are a true legend in the world, and I bet most of the people are using apple's product to share their thoughts. I MISS YOU.</p>

      <h2> Good bye Steve, See you</h2>
          <p>Steve, I'm brand new at Apple world. I felt doubts about leaving PC utilities and jump into Mac. Your speech at Stanford University was definitively, even it is not related with hardware or software decision, the reason why I join Apple world. I'm feel so sad see you leaving. I want to believe that I knew you through Apple products. That's it. My condolences to your family and all the people that loves you. </p>

      <h2> Monumental loss</h2>
          <p>I just don't know what to say. Words can't do justice to the accomplishments and change brought about by just one man, who regrettably and unfortunately died in his prime. I only wish Steve can continue seeing the impact he has made, and the thriving of the company he has built. He envisioned a dream, and lived that dream as a true, sincere person. As a CEO who was ousted from his own company, Steve picked himself up and continued taking steps forward. As a returned veteran to a dream he calls home, he passionately revitalized a losing company with renewed vigour. His accomplishments are his legacy, and his passion and attitude are our inspiration. As much as I respect his achievements, it's his attitude, and genuine passion to live his life doing what he WANTS to do that I truly admire</p>

     <h2>R.I.P. Steve Job; Best man!</h2>
          <p>Hello, I never knew Steve Jobs, but he looks like a very nice and smart person, I am 15 and I live in Canada, and he has been my favourite person! Because of him I was able to enjoy the things that he made and brought to this world, and I today will continue to love him technology! This is just so upsetting that he is gone and I know that the iPhone 4s was the last piece that he had designed, So Apple please continue Steve Jobs passion and step ups for new products! R.I.P. Steve Jobs!! God bless u and God bless your company!</p>
