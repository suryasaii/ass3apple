    <h2> Remembering Steve</h2>
          <p>I sit here recollecting and typing on the first Apple product that I purchased five years ago, the MacBook. You are one of the greatest innovator of our time. Just like this laptop, your ideas, your imagination, your creativity, and your legacy will never be die.</p>

       <h2>U will always be missed and remembered</h2>
          <p>Thank you for everything you've done to change the world Mr. Jobs. You are a true legend in the world, and I bet most of the people are using apple's product to share their thoughts. I MISS YOU.</p>

      <h2> Good bye Steve, See you</h2>
         <p>Steve, I'm brand new at Apple world. I felt doubts about leaving PC utilities and jump into Mac. Your speech at Stanford University was definitively, even it is not related with hardware or software decision, the reason why I join Apple world. I'm feel so sad see you leaving. I want to believe that I knew you through Apple products. That's it. My condolences to your family and all the people that loves you. </p>
